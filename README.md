Anti-coronavirus drugs

This is the GitHub site that includes our annotated information and categorization of anti-coronavirus drugs. The drugs are then mapped to ontologies and imported to the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO). Ontology-based methods are then further used to analyze the  drug results. 

This research was conducted at the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.
