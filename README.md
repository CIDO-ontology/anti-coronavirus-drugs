# Anti-coronavirus Drugs
Systematic annotation, ontology representation, and analysis of anti-coronavirus drugs

Our systematic literature collection and annotation identified 106 chemical drugs and 31 antibodies effective against the infection of at least one human coronavirus (including SARS-CoV, SAR-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV) in vitro or in vivo in an experimental or clinical setting. A total of 168 drug protein targets were identified, and 128 biological processes involving the drug targets were significantly enriched based on a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) was used as an ontological platform to represent the anti-coronaviral drugs, active chemical compounds of these drugs, drug targets, biological processes, viruses, and the relations among these entities. In addition to new term generation, CIDO also reused many terms from existing ontologies and developed new relations and axioms to semantically represented our annotated knowledge. 

The CIDO also provides a platform for our systematic analysis of all the anti-coronavirus drugs. Ontology-based methods are then further used to analyze the  drug results. 

This research was conducted at the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.
